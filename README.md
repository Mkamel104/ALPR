# Automatic License Plate Detection and Recognition from Videos in Real Time (ALPR_realTime)
Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) has been a frequent topic of research due to many practical applications such as smart parking systems, and law enforcement. In recent years there has been an increased commercial interest in systems for automatic license plate recognition. Some of the existing systems process single images only, some even requiring vehicles to stop in front of a gate so that a still image of good quality can be taken. This project presents an approach that makes it possible to detect and recognize the license plate from video in real-time using a pre-trained model for character segmentation and recognition.
